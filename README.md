# Python Projects for CSC 210

## Overview

Welcome to the **Python Projects for CSC 210** repository! This repository contains several Python projects that focus on algorithms, data structures, and applications related to the course **CSC 210**. The projects cover a range of topics, including **virtual memory emulation** and **data compression**.

---

## Projects Included

1. **Virtual Memory Emulation**  
   - This project simulates the behavior of a **CPU**, **Main Memory**, and a **Page Table**. It demonstrates how virtual memory operates in a simplified system, including the mapping between virtual addresses and physical memory addresses.

2. **Lempel-Ziv Compression Algorithm**  
   - This project implements the **Lempel-Ziv compression algorithm**, a lossless data compression algorithm that is commonly used in various compression utilities. The algorithm compresses data by encoding repeated patterns of bits, reducing the overall size of the data.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to provide a collection of projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts in **computer science** using **Python**. These projects help in understanding key topics such as:

- Virtual memory management in operating systems.
- Data compression techniques, particularly the **Lempel-Ziv algorithm**.

Each project is designed to showcase how Python can be used to manage complex data efficiently while performing tasks like memory simulation and data compression.
